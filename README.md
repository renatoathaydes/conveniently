# Conveniently.

Write Dart code more conveniently.

This is a tiny package that offers some very convenient utilities that you may use quite often
once you know they exist.

## Types

### `Result<V>`

The `Result` type is used to represent the result of a computation. It may be either successful
(an instance of `Ok`) or a failure (of type `Fail`).

It helps enforce error checking as the caller of a function returning `Result` is forced to
_inspect_ the returned value for errors, as opposed to with `Exception`s.

You normally obtain a `Result` by calling `catching` or `catching$` (see more examples at the end of this page).

```dart
final result = catching$(() {
  // run computation that may throw
});

// pattern match to handle the result
Object value = switch (result) {
  Ok(value: var v) => v,
  Fail() => 'error'
};
```

You can also create a `Result` by invoking its factory methods:

```dart
Result<String> result;
result = Result.ok('yes');
result = Result.fail(FormatException());
```

To change the type `V` of a `Result<V>`, use its `map` or `flatMap` functions.

> If the mapper function throws, `map` and `flatMap` return a `Fail` Result with a
> `MappingFailureException` within it.

Example:

```dart

Result<int> result = Result.ok('yes').map((s) => s.length);
```

## Top-level functions

> A few functions have both synchronous and async versions. In such cases, the synchronous
> function's name appends `$` to the async function's name.
> The Dart stdlib normally adds the `Sync` suffix in such cases, but I thought `$` would be
> a better suffix as it's shorter and I can quickly internalize it as meaning `Sync` in my head.

* `timing`    - time a computation (asynchronous).
* `timing$`   - time a computation (synchronous).
* `catching`  - enforce error handling (asynchronous).
* `catching$`  - enforce error handling (synchronous).

## Extension functions

### on `<T>` (any type, including nullable types)

* `vmap`    - map over any value.
* `apply`   - call a given function taking the receiver, return the receiver (asynchronous).
* `apply$`  - call a given function taking the receiver, return the receiver (asynchronous).

This is particularly convenient to _capture_ fields, e.g. in cases like this:

```dart
class Person {
  final String? name;
  const Person(this.name);

  // DOES NOT COMPILE!
  // @override toString() {
    // if (name == null) return '<No name>';
    // Even though 'name' is final, a subtype could turn it into a mutable getter.
    // return name.capitalize();
  // }
  
  @override toString() {
    // using `vmap` and `apply`ing a side-effecting function 
    return name?.vmap((n) => n.capitilize()).apply(print) ?? '<No name>';
  }
}
```

### on `<T?>` (any nullable type)

* `vmapOr`  - map over the value if non-null, or provide a default value.
* `orThrow` - get the value if non-null, or throw an error otherwise.

`orThrow` exists due to Dart not allowing this:

```dart
Object? nullableValue = null;

// In Dart, this is ok:
final someValue = nullableValue ?? 'yes!';

// MISSING DART FUNCTIONALITY - DOES NOT COMPILE
final value = nullableValue ?? throw Exception('a good error message here');

// the '!' operator also does it, but does not give a good error for end users.
final nonNullValue = nullableValue!;

// orThrow to the rescue
final aValue = nullableValue.orThrow(() => ArgumentError('missing something', 'value'));
```

### on `int`

* `times`         - run some action N times, asynchronously.
* `times$`        - run some action N times, synchronously.
* `timesIndex`    - run some action N times taking an iteration index, asynchronously.
* `timesIndex$`   - run some action N times taking an iteration index, synchronously.

The async `times` functions accept an optional `waitIterations` parameter which determines whether
each iteration should wait for the previous one to complete before starting.
By default, `waitIterations` is `true`. Setting it to `false` causes all iterations to start
immediately.

### on `bool Function(T)` and `Future<bool> Function(T)` (predicates)

* `not`   - negate an asynchronous predicate.
* `not$`  - negate a synchronous predicate.

## Examples

```dart
import 'package:conveniently/conveniently.dart';

/// Conveniently examples.
///
/// Functions whose name ends with '$' indicate they are "synchronous",
/// and dropping the '$' gives the corresponding async function's name.
void main() {
  // do something N times
  3.times$(() => print('Conveniently'));

  // with an index
  2.timesIndex$((i) => print('Conveniently $i'));

  // map over any value
  print(10.vmap((i) => i + 1)); // prints 11

  // nullable helpers make it more like Optional
  Object? nullable;
  nullable = 'foo';
  print(nullable.vmapOr((v) => 'v = $v', () => 'none')); // prints 'v = foo'
  print(nullable.orThrow(ArgumentError.new)); // prints 'foo'
  nullable = null;
  print(nullable.vmapOr((v) => 'v = $v', () => 'none')); // prints 'none'

  // vmap and vmapOr help writing pipelines with nullable values
  nullable
      .vmapOr((s) => 'Some $s', () => 'default value')
      .vmap((v) => 'v not null here: ${v.hashCode}')
      .apply$(print) // use side-effect operations with apply/apply$
      .vmap(
          (s) => print(s.toUpperCase())); // prints 'V NOT NULL HERE: 305987627'

  // `not` can be used to negate a predicate
  bool isEven(int n) => n % 2 == 0;
  final isOdd = isEven.not$;
  print([1, 2, 3, 4].where(isOdd)); // prints (1, 3)

  // convert Exceptions to values to enforce error checking
  final result = catching$(() => 'function that may throw');

  // pattern match to get a value out of Result
  print(switch (result) {
    Ok(value: var v) => 'Success: $v',
    Fail(exception: var e) => 'FAILURE: $e',
  });

  // or use the getters
  print('Result is error? ${result.isError}, '
      'success: ${result.successOrNull}, '
      'failure: ${result.failureOrNull}');
}

```

## Other interesting helper libraries

* [dart-quiver](https://pub.dev/packages/quiver) - Quiver is a set of utility libraries for Dart that makes using many
  Dart libraries easier and more convenient, or adds additional functionality.
* [fpdart](https://pub.dev/packages/fpdart) - All the main functional programming types and patterns fully documented,
  tested, and with examples.
* [collection](https://pub.dev/packages/collection) - Contains utility functions and classes in the style
  of `dart:collection`
  to make working with collections easier.

**Quiver** has lots of helper utilities grouped in a few libraries:

* `quiver.async`
* `quiver.cache`
* `quiver.check`
* `quiver.collection`
* `quiver.core`
* `quiver.string`
* `quiver.time`

And more...

But no tiny functions like `conveniently`.

**`fpdart`** is a much more comprehensive library for Functional Programming enthusiasts.
`conveniently` doesn't try to provide anything like what `fpdart` does,
(despite providing a few functions that are also helpful when doing FP) so it's a much smaller package.

**`collection`** provides lots of helper functions that work with Dart collections. It's pretty good at that,
which is why `conveniently` does not attempt to provide collections helpers at all.
